  once you are in your prefered dircetory type in these commands `git clone` , `space bar` , `command + V` , `return`.
  
  Great!! Now you have the app in your local device!!! But we are not done yet!! Now We have to set up the enviornment!! 
  
#### Setting up your local enviornment 

  now that we have your new Monster Shop app on your local device lets get it ready for you to use!! 
  
  fist type `cd monster_shop_1911` 
  
  Next we are going to type in `bundle install` , `return`
  
  After you have waited for a while for everything you install, we are still not done, now we have to make a database
  We are going to run the following commands hitting `return` after each command. 
  
  `rake db:create`
  
  `rake db:migrate`
  
  `rake db:seed`
  
  Assuming that you did not get any errors your database is now set up!!! But let us make sure we don't have any testing 
  issues. So lets run 
  
  `bundle exec rspec` 
  
  you should have all passing tests!!! If for some reason you do not please message one of the contributers above. 
  
  Congragulations!!! your app is ready!!! now we can see the code and every test passes, all that is left is to see if the app
  looks locally. 
  
#### Seeing your app live 

  Next we are going to run `rails s` if you did it right (which lets face it, if you didn't then you probably shouldn't be coding) either way this is what your `CLI` should look like.

  next lets see this bad boy on the browser, So we are going to open a new tab in our browser and in your URL bar and type in
  `localhost:3000` and if you did this right then this is what you should be looking at.

#### Wrap up 

  Our code is clean and follows C.R.U.D. functionality and is very Restful. However we could have better options in our app 
  and much better C.S.S. 
  
  We hope that you enjoy our app as much as we enjoyed making it!!! As always feedback is welcome. Thank you!
